# AIBotForge
BotForge is the first Web3-native marketplace for AI-powered autonomous agents—"bots" that users can create, monetize, and own on-chain. It transforms GenAI into a viral asset class by allowing users to mint and trade custom AI bots that are embedded with utility, personality, and commercial power.

We're solving a fundamental gap in the AI economy: AI agents today are siloed, non-ownable, and non-transferable. BotForge turns these agents into on-chain digital assets—tokenized AI agents—that can be bought, sold, interacted with, or licensed by anyone, across any EVM-compatible chain.

When a user chats with a bot, the bot’s creator earns revenue. When a bot is sold, the original owner earns royalties. This unlocks a new trillion-dollar creator economy, where AI agents can be deployed, discovered, and traded—just like NFTs or tokens—with automated, on-chain revenue splits and ownership logic.

BotForge introduces an AI-native marketplace economy with transparent monetization, scarcity-based ranking (the more desired a bot, the higher its price rises), and cross-chain compatibility—making it the first AI asset layer designed for mass adoption and virality.

Our platform is already live on Sepolia testnet with plans to expand across Avalanche and other EVM chains.
